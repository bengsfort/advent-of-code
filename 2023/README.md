# 2023

2023 Advent of Code.

Language choice: C++
Reasoning:
> While I can fiddle around and read C++, I don't feel quite as comfortable writing it myself from scratch so figured this would be the perfect practice for it; especially considering it is looking like more and more C++ might be in my near future.

## Pre-requisites

- [CMake](https://cmake.org/)

## Quickstart

```sh
# Build specific day from command line
$ cd day1
$ cmake .		# Generate build scripts
$ make			# actually generate executable
$ ./build/day1 	# Execute

# Generate build scripts for all
$ cmake .

# Generate build scripts + IDE files
$ cmake -G Xcode .				# xcode...
$ cmake -G "Visual Studio" .	# VS
```
